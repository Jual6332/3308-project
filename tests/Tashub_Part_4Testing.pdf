Title: Taskhub
vision: A centralized system that comprehensively tracks employee performance through task completion history


Automated Tests: Our team chose to do one main automated test to make sure the final worked along with several smaller ones. The program used was Selenium for these autmated tests.
The reason that, as the descriptions below state, you need to use a preloaded databases, for the tests, is becasue of a random number generator made it hard to predict numbers for the test case; thus, we preloaded some test values as a get around to having
to copy those numbers.

Testing Tashub
  1. Download the last version of Firefox and Selenium
  2. Recreate an empty taskhub table. (probably wont matter but just in case you created the same users as me)
  3.using "loadDB2.sql" copy into the tables then run the testing script clicking okay on the pop up windows
  4. using one of the following selenium source files go to edit new test case and copy and paste that source into the source tab or export one of the files as a test Case
        a. test_login.selenium signs up a new user and logs him in
        b. test_everything.selenium loogs 3 users in making two of them the manager of one then one of the managers assines tasks to the employee; that employee then edits the tasks progress then completes task; finally it sings back into the manager to give that employee a grade for that task.
        c.test_signup.selenium signs user 3 in
  4. run thos scripts using Selenium and Firefox and play current test 
  5. press okay to the pop up alerts
